# layout-practice

A [second](https://coda.io/@metalamp/education/front-end-2) task from a Metalamp course 

## Installation

Command

```bash
npm run start
```
will start a webpack server. But if live reload isn't working, then you can make next.

Write in terminal:

```bash
npm run watch
```

and start any server you like (i use [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for VSC)
